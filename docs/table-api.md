# Table API and extension boundary

Status: complete table API documentation for the Selenide q4j subsystem port.

This document describes the table API shipped by Selenide. It is deliberately an API record, not a history of the table pull requests.

## Public type and dependency map

The public structural contract is in `com.codeborne.selenide.table.model`:

- `TableModel<C>` exposes displayed headers, currently mounted rows, typed-column lookup, and optional/required row lookup.
- `TableRow<C>` exposes an optional cell and a required-cell convenience method.
- `TableCell<C>` exposes its typed column key and current text.
- `DisplayedHeaderResolver<C>` maps a caller-owned key to the header text displayed by the DOM.

`SelenideDomTableModel<C>` is the Selenide implementation of `TableModel<C>`. It depends on
`SelenideElement`, `ElementsCollection`, and Selenium `By`; those are intentionally not part of
the neutral structural contract. `TableDomAdapter` is a Selenide/Selenium-specific description of
relative root, row, cell, and header locators. `TableDomAdapters` supplies `classic()`, `flex()`,
`horizontal()`, `ariaGrid()`, and `of(...)`.

The additive Selenide navigation layer consists of `SelenideTableQuery`, row/column/cell
references, `RowConditions`, and the table/row/column assertion and action handles. Legacy
`Table`, `DynamicTable`, `FlexTable`, `HorizontalTable`, and their existing FQCNs remain
available. `DomTableLayout` and its compatibility constructor bridge the old layout enum.

## Consumer examples

A built-in HTML table can be exposed from a page object without relying on enum ordinal order:

```java
TableModel<Column> model = SelenideDomTableModel.of(
    Selenide.$("#customers"),
    TableDomAdapters.classic(),
    DisplayedHeaderResolver.requiringNonNull(Column::displayed));

TableRow<Column> row = model.requiredRow(
    candidate -> candidate.cell(Column.COMPANY)
        .map(cell -> cell.text().equals("Alfreds")).orElse(false),
    "company", Duration.ofSeconds(2));

assertThat(row.requiredCell(Column.COUNTRY).text()).isEqualTo("Austria");
```

A project-specific DOM shape uses relative locators. The selectors are evaluated below the current
root, so nested tables are not accidentally included when the row selector is scoped:

```java
TableDomAdapter grid = TableDomAdapters.of(
    By.cssSelector(":scope > .data-row"),
    By.cssSelector(":scope > .cell:not([hidden])"),
    new TableHeaderRowLocator(
        By.cssSelector(":scope > .header-row"),
        By.cssSelector(":scope > .cell:not([hidden])")));
TableModel<Column> customDom = SelenideDomTableModel.of(
    Selenide.$("#project-grid"), grid,
    DisplayedHeaderResolver.requiringNonNull(Column::displayed));
```

A fully custom backend does not need Selenide or Selenium. Implement the three structural
interfaces and keep any lookup, remount, or transport policy in that implementation:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Optional;
import com.codeborne.selenide.table.model.TableCell;
import com.codeborne.selenide.table.model.TableModel;
import com.codeborne.selenide.table.model.TableRow;

enum Column { COUNTRY, COMPANY }

final class ApiModel implements TableModel<Column> {
  private final List<ApiRow> dataRows = List.of(new ApiRow(Map.of(
      Column.COUNTRY, "Austria", Column.COMPANY, "Alfreds")));

  @Override public List<String> displayedHeaders() { return List.of("Country", "Company"); }
  @Override public List<ApiRow> rows() { return dataRows; }
}

final class ApiRow implements TableRow<Column> {
  private final Map<Column, String> values;
  ApiRow(Map<Column, String> values) { this.values = Map.copyOf(values); }
  @Override public Optional<ApiCell> cell(Column key) {
    return Optional.ofNullable(values.get(key)).map(value -> new ApiCell(key, value));
  }
}

record ApiCell(Column column, String text) implements TableCell<Column> {}
```

This backend-neutral example proves only the structural model contract. Header exclusion, nested
DOM isolation, remount behavior, and timeout policy belong to the concrete backend and are not
claims of this example. The compiling equivalent is exercised by
`TableModelContractTest.supportsFullyCustomBackendContract`.

## Semantics and compatibility

- In this neutral typed-key model, keys are resolved by displayed header text; enum ordinal is never
  a column position. This documents the model's contract only and does not impose ordinal semantics
  on custom adapters or unrelated APIs.
- `displayedHeaders()` and `rows()` reflect the model's current view. A row or cell may be lazy.
- Selenide-backed rows, columns, and cells retain locators/indexes, not raw `WebElement` objects;
  each operation re-resolves the current root. Handles therefore remain usable after a root
  replacement, provided the replacement still satisfies the adapter contract.
- `rows()` and `row(predicate)` are non-waiting status reads. Selenide's `requiredRow(..., timeout)`
  uses one Selenide condition loop and one caller-provided timeout across root and row discovery.
- A missing row is `TableRowNotFoundException`; a missing displayed header is
  `TableColumnNotFoundException`; a repeated displayed header is `TableColumnAmbiguousException`;
  a missing required cell is `TableCellNotFoundException`. `uniqueRow` throws
  `TableRowAmbiguousException` when more than one row matches and includes the observed match
  count. Required-row diagnostics include the caller description and timeout; column-not-found
  diagnostics include the requested key, its displayed name, and available headers. Optional row
  and cell lookups return `Optional.empty()` for absence, while required variants throw the typed
  not-found exception.
- A mounted empty cell is present and has empty text. A missing cell is absent.
- `findRow`/`requiredRow` select the first match; `findRows` preserves all matches in DOM order;
  `uniqueRow` rejects both zero and multiple matches.
- The built-in classic adapter accepts ordinary `<td>` data cells and semantic
  `<th scope="row">` cells. Header-only rows are excluded. Relative selectors also exclude rows
  owned by nested tables; a nested table can be selected separately as its own model root.
- Flex, horizontal, and ARIA-grid adapters use their documented row/header semantics. Hidden cells
  can be excluded by a custom adapter's locator. Non-rectangular rows remain deterministic: a
  missing cell is absent rather than synthesized.

Released `0.6.0` FQCNs and signatures are preserved. New consumers should prefer the structural
interfaces and `TableDomAdapters.of(...)`; no existing legacy type is renamed or removed.

## Compatibility boundary and future backend plugins

The public structural contracts (`TableModel<C>`, `TableRow<C>`, and `TableCell<C>`) are the
extension contract. The current Selenide browser integration is one backend adapter/plugin
implementation: `TableDomAdapter`, `SelenideDomTableModel`, `SelenideTableQuery`, and all
query/assertion/action APIs remain Selenide/Selenium-specific. `By`, `SelenideElement`, and
Selenide's driver and wait policies are not framework-neutral contracts.

The intended future shape is a separately published external Appium plugin/module. It may depend
on the structural contracts and provide its own backend implementation, queries, actions, and
driver integration; it is not part of q4j or this change. The dependency direction is:

```text
future external Appium plugin/module ──depends on──▶ structural contracts
current Selenide backend adapter       ──depends on──▶ structural contracts
q4j core/Selenide implementation       ──must not depend on or discover──▶ Appium
```

No Appium dependency, type, driver setup, fixture, runtime implementation, plugin loading, or
`ServiceLoader` mechanism is introduced by this PR. Existing 0.6.0 FQCNs and q4j table consumers
remain unchanged.

At present, the structural contracts are packaged in Selenide core and package,
which also depends on Selenide. Consequently, a future external plugin may be forced to pull
Selenide transitively; the boundary is structurally neutral but the published artifact is not yet
dependency-neutral. Extracting the contracts to a neutral artifact/package is a future-major
compatibility action because moving the released FQCNs now would break callers.

## Non-goals and deferred shapes

This issue does not add sorting, filtering, pagination, selection, editing, virtualization, infinite
scrolling, pinned/frozen columns, merged cells, or expandable/tree/master-detail rows. Nested tables
are supported only as isolated model roots; there is no nested-table expansion API. These shapes need
separate contracts before a compatible API can be designed. It also does not implement or package
an Appium backend: any Appium integration is a future external plugin/module boundary only, with no
q4j runtime discovery mechanism.

## Verification map

`TableModelContractTest` is hermetic and exercises ordinary `<td>` rows, semantic row headers,
header-only exclusion, a direct-child custom div-grid adapter, hidden cells, a mounted empty cell
and an omitted short-row cell,
non-rectangular row, nested custom-grid isolation, delayed custom rendering, custom root remount,
duplicate/headerless failures, and a fully custom backend. `TableQueryContractTest` and `TableAssertionsActionsContractTest` cover the
Selenide-specific navigation and handles. No external site or Appium implementation is required.
